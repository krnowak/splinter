    <h2>Splinter Patch Review</h2>
    <p>
      Splinter is an add-on for Bugzilla to allow conveniently
      reviewing patches that people have attached to
      Bugzilla. <a href="http://fishsoup.net/software/splinter">More
      information about Splinter</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>The patch review view</h3>
    <p>
      If you get to Splinter by clicking on a link next to an
      attachment in Bugzilla, you are presented with the patch
      review view. This view has a number of different pages that can
      be switched between with the links at the top of the screen.
      The first page is the Overview page, the other pages correspond to
      individual files changed by the review.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Overview page, from top to bottom are shown:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Introductory text to the patch. For a patch that was created
      using 'git format-patch' this will be the Git commit
      message.</li>
      <li>Controls for creating a new review</li>
      <li>Previous reviews that other people have written.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The pages for each file show a two-column view of the changes.
      The left column is the previous contents of the file,
      the right column is the new contents of the file. (If the file
      is an entirely new file or an entirely deleted file, only one
      column will be shown.) Red indicates lines that have been
      removed, green lines that have been added, and blue lines that
      were modified.
    </p>
    <p>
      If people have previously made comments on individual lines of
      the patch, they will show up both summarized on the Overview
      page and also inline when looking at the files of the patch.
    </p>
    <h3>Reviewing an existing patch</h3>
    <p>
      There are three components to a review:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        An overall comment. The text area on the first page allows
        you to enter your overall thoughts on the bug.
      </li>
      <li>
        Detailed comments on changes within the files. To comment on a
        line in a patch, double click on it, and a text area will open
        beneath that comment. When you are done, click the Save button
        to save your comment or the Cancel button to throw your
        comment away. You can double-click on a saved comment to start
        editing it again and make further changes.
      </li>
      <li>
        A change to the attachment status. (This is specific to
        Bugzilla instances that have attachment status, which is a
        non-upstream patch. It's somewhat similar to attachment flags,
        which splinter doesn't currently support displaying or
        changing.) This allows you to mark a patch as read to commit
        or needing additional work. This is done by changing the
        drop-down next to the Publish button.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once you are done writing your review, go back to Overview page
      and click the "Publish" button to submit it as a comment on the
      bug. The comment will have a link back to the review page so
      that people can see your comments with the full context.
    </p>
    <h3>Saved drafts</h3>
    <p>
      Whenever you start making changes, a draft is automatically
      saved. If you come back to the patch review page for the same
      attachment, that draft will automatically be resumed. Drafts are
      not visible to anybody else until published.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that saving drafts requires the your browser to have support
      for the "DOM Storage" standard. At time of writing, this is
      available only in a few very recent browsers, like Firefox
      3.5. Strict privacy protections like disabling cookies may also
      disable DOM Storage, since it provides another mechanism for
      sites to track information about their users.
    </p>
    <h3>Responding to someone's review</h3>
    <p>
      A response is treated just like any other review and created the
      same way. A couple of features are helpful when responding: you
      can double-click on an inline comment to respond to it. And on
      the overview page, when you click on a detailed comment, you are
      taken directly to the original location of the comment.
    </p>
    <h3>Uploading patches for review</h3>
    <p>
      Splinter doesn't really care how patches are provided to
      Bugzilla, as long as they are well-formatted patches. If you are
      using Git for version control, you can either format changes as
      patches
      using <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-format-patch.html">'git
      format-patch</a> and attach them manually to the bug, or you
      can
      use <a href="http://fishsoup.net/software/git-bz">git-bz</a>.
      git-bz is highly recommended; it automates most of the steps
      that Splinter can't handle: it files new bugs, attaches updated
      attachments to existing bugs, and closes bugs when you push the
      corresponding git commits to your central repository.
    </p>
    <h3>The bug review view</h3>
    <p>
      Splinter also has a view where it shows all patches attached to
      the bug with their status and links to review them. You are
      taken to this page after publishing a review. You can also get
      to this page with the bug link in the upper-right corner of the
      patch review view.
    </p>
    <h3>Your reviews</h3>
    <p>
      Splinter can also show you a list of all your draft and
      published reviews. Access this page with the "Your reviews"
      link at the bottom of the bug review view. In-progress drafts
      are shown in bold.
