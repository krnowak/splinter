splinter_proxy.py
=================
This is a simple HTTP server written in Python to support hacking on
Splinter. Because of cross-site scripting restrictions, the splinter
code must live on the same HTTP server as the Bugzilla URLs it
accesses to get bug data. In production, Splinter is simply installed
on the Bugzilla server, but setting up a test instance of Bugzilla
is frequently not convenient: it requires a huge set of Perl modules,
a MySQL server and a fair bit of configuration.

So, splinter_proxy.py presents a virtual server that combines the
Splinter content with proxied redirection of the necessary Bugzilla
URL's to an existing instance of bugzilla.

Authentication to the Bugzilla server is done by splinter_proxy.py
based on putting a fixed Bugzilla login and password into its
configuration. This means that ANYBODY WHO CAN CONNECT TO THE PROXY
CAN DO ANYTHING AS THE CONFIGURED user.

splinter_proxy.py by default only binds to the "local" interface
127.0.0.1 and it will ignore the configured login/password if it is
configured to bind to a different interface. (The ability to bind to a
different interface and run anonymously is intended for creating a
public read-only demo of Splinter; it's not particularly useful for
development.)

So, as long as you run it on a personal system that only you have
login access to you should be OK.

Usage
=====
* Copy config.py.example to config.py
* Replace 'bugzilla.example.com' with your server, and edit
  bugzilla_login, and bugzilla_password appropriately.
* Run
  ./splinter_proxy.py
* Connect to http://127.0.0.1:23080/index.html in your web browser
