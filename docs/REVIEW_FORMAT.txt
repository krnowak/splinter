A review is based upon a diff (conventionally a unified diff,
but the actual format doesn't matter. All lines mentioned in the
review must, however, be in the diff, either as an edited line
or as context.)

In Bugzilla, reviews are represented Bugzilla comments that start with
the text "Review of attachment <attachment_id>:" The attachment
referred to must be a patch.

The review can start with free form comments that apply to the whole
patch.  A line of the form ::: <filename> introduces comments about a
particular file

Comments are represented in a form somewhat similar to a "hunk" of a
unified diff. A comment is of three types, distinguished by the
leading text of the intro:

REMOVED: @@ -I,J @@

  A comment about the line I+J-1 in the old version of the file.

ADDED: @@ +K,L @@

  A comment about the line K+L-1 in the new version of the file.

CHANGED: @@ -I,J +K,L @@

  A comment about the lines in the range [I,J) in the old version
  of the file being turned into the range [K,L) in the new version
  of the file.

As with a unified diff, the header is followed by lines beginning
with:

 ' ' - a line of context
 '-' - a removed line
 '+' - an added line
 '\' - suppresses the newline on the previous line

 J = lines of context + added lines
 L = lines of context + removed lines

The actually text following the first character isn't important for
the automated parsing of the review - it's there to make the review
human readable. It would be normally be the line from the old or new
version as appropriate, though long lines might possibly be truncated
or white space normalized.

In addition, an abbrevation is supported: if a line begins with

 ... N <possibly more text>

Then that means that there are N lines of the previous type omitted.

After all the lines specified by the header have been used up, following
lines up to the next line beginning with "@@" or ":::" is the text
of the comment. (Leading and trailing whitespace on the comment is
ignore.)


Example
=======

Given the unified diff

==========
--- animal-list
+++ animal-list

-Sturgeon
+Vole
\ No newline at end of file
==========

A review might look like:

==========
I don't really understand the rhyme and reason behind this change,
it seems pretty random.

::: animal-list
@@ -10,6 +10,3 @@

Here you've removed three Australian animals without any replacements

@@ -14,2 @@
-Koala
-Kookaburra

I'm particularly sad to see the Kookaburra. It has two K's.

@@ +15,2 @@
 Quetzalcoatl
+Vole
\ No newline at end of file

The vole is a nice addition to the list. The last line should end
with a newline too to keep 'vi' users happy.
==========

Note that it's OK for lines to appear in multiple comments - the lines
'-Koala' '-Kookaburra' are in both the first comment and in the second
comment. The one restriction is that two reviews of the same type
can't end with the same line. (For a changed review, the pair of
old-line and new-line must be distinct.)
