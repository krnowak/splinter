Reviews are comments that start with the text "Review of attachment <attachment_id>:"

The review can start with free form comments that apply to the whole patch.
A line of the form ::: <filename> introduces comments about a particular file

Each comment is introduced by a small amount of context, which is formatted as
a unified diff hunk.
