About
=====

Splinter is a light-weight addition to Bugzilla that allows a patch
reviewer to view a nicely formatted version of a patch in their
web browser and add comments on particular sections.

Subsequent reviewers or the original patch author can then view the
comments inline in the Splinter display of the patch.

Reviews are saved to the bug as specially formatted comments that
combine small amounts of unified-diff like output with the review
comments. The output is designed to be both machine-parseable and
also meaningful to someone who is viewing it straight without using
Splinter.

Splinter is written as a Javascript front end on top of existing
HTML interfaces exported by Bugzilla. All the work of parsing patches,
formatting them, etc, is done in Javascript.

Installation
============

You can run Splinter locally for yourself with the splinter_proxy.py
tool - see proxy/README for installation.

The basic idea of a hosted install is to install Splinter onto the
same server as as Bugzilla. Set up aliases or mod_rewrite so that
/review/ is mapped onto the web/ directory of the location you
installed Splinter.

There will eventually be a small Bugzilla extension to add links from
review comments and from the attachments list to the Splinter 
review page.

Why the name
============

The name "Splinter" has two connotations - first it suggests the
process of taking a big patch and breaking it apart and commenting on
individual sections. Secondly, its a bit of a homage to Review Board
(http://www.review-board.org/). Seeing the screenshots I wanted
something like that, but without disrupting my existing workflow of
attaching patches to Bugzilla bugs and marking review status there.
So, Splinter is "the smallest thing possible that gives an effect
something like Review Board" - a splinter of a board.
