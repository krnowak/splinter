About
=====

Splinter is a light-weight addition to Bugzilla that allows a patch
reviewer to view a nicely formatted version of a patch in their
web browser and add comments on particular sections.

Subsequent reviewers or the original patch author can then view the
comments inline in the Splinter display of the patch.

Reviews are saved to the bug as specially formatted comments that
combine small amounts of unified-diff like output with the review
comments. The output is designed to be both machine-parseable and
also meaningful to someone who is viewing it straight without using
Splinter.

Splinter is written as a Javascript front end on top of existing
HTML interfaces exported by Bugzilla. All the work of parsing patches,
formatting them, etc, is done in Javascript.

Installation
============

You can run Splinter locally for yourself with the splinter_proxy.py
tool - see proxy/README for installation.

To add it to a Bugzilla installation, simply run:

 make install BUGZILLA_ROOT=/path/to/bugzilla/installation

You'll need to do this as root or as another user with permissions
to change ownership of files to the web server group.

By default, Splinter will have the URL /page.cgi?id=splinter.html, which
is ugly and leaks implementation details that may change. This URL can
be changed from the "Splinter Patch Review" section of "Parameters" in
the Bugzilla Adminstration pages. If you change it (the recommendation is
to use /review), you'll have to use mod_rewrite or other web server
configuration to forward the pretty URL to the right place. The
parameter description includes instructions for mod_rewrite.

Why the name
============

The name "Splinter" has two connotations - first it suggests the
process of taking a big patch and breaking it apart and commenting on
individual sections. Secondly, its a bit of a homage to Review Board
(http://www.review-board.org/). Seeing the screenshots I wanted
something like that, but without disrupting my existing workflow of
attaching patches to Bugzilla bugs and marking review status there.
So, Splinter is "the smallest thing possible that gives an effect
something like Review Board" - a splinter of a board.
